# [HowToPGP](http://howtopgp.jugendhackt.de/)

A [Jugend hackt](http://jugendhackt.de/) project.

We want to explain [PGP-encryption](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)
simple and understandable for everyone. PGP is a very secure way to encrypt your e-mails, but is it not that easy to install and to use. Only by teaching a wide range of people how to use encryption, we are able to stop mass surveillance.
